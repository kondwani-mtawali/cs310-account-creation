1. Initially the user input is read using the read function/command. I then stored it by simply defining a variable with the
'$'sign followed by the curly brackets with variable mentioned at the end of read.

2. The username value was created by replacing the space(" ") with a dash("-"). I created another variable Fusername which took the initial username
I defined and changed all its character to lower case. I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but with the documentation provided that was the most 
straightforward way in my head.
